**Food Name Extraction Method**

**Step 1:** Extract key ingredients from the ingredients list that hint at a specific food type. In this case, two key ingredients stand out: ""Tomato Paste"" and ""Pasta"". The presence of tomato paste, along with noodles, is highly indicative of a classic Italian dish known for combining tomatoes, cheese, and pasta.

**Step 2:** Combine the extracted words with the product type from the product name ""Italian Pizza Pasta"" to get a more specific food name.

**Food Name:** Italian (from product name) + Pizza (from key ingredients and product name)

The food name of the product is **Italian Pizza**."

"To calculate the nutritional information from a food package label, you can use the following steps:

**Step 1: Identify the nutritional information**

* Look for the ""Nutrition Facts"" table on the label.
* Extract the serving size and number of servings per container from the table.

**Step 2: Calculate the nutritional information per serving**

* Divide each nutrient value by the number of servings per container to get the amount per serving.

**Step 3: Calculate the nutritional information per 100g**

* Divide each nutrient value by the serving size (in grams) and multiply by 100 to get the amount per 100g.

**Example Calculations**

Let's say the Nutrition Facts table shows:

* Serving size: 1 bottle (237mL)
* Number of servings per container: 6

**Nutrient Values**

* Calories: 360
* Total Fat: 14g
* Saturated Fat: 2g
* Cholesterol: 10mg
* Sodium: 200mg
* Total Carbohydrate: 45g
* Dietary Fiber: 1g
* Sugars: 24g
* Protein: 14g

**Calculations**

* Calories per serving: 360/6 = 60 calories/serving
* Total Fat per serving: 14g/6 = 2.33g/serving
* Saturated Fat per serving: 2g/6 = 0.33g/serving
* Cholesterol per serving: 10mg/6 = 1.67mg/serving
* Sodium per serving: 200mg/6 = 33.33mg/serving
* Total Carbohydrate per serving: 45g/6 = 7.5g/serving
* Dietary Fiber per serving: 1g/6 = 0.17g/serving
* Sugars per serving: 24g/6 = 4g/serving
* Protein per serving: 14g/6 = 2.33g/serving
